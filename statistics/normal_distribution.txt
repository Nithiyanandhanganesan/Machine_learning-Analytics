A normal distribution, sometimes called the bell curve, is a distribution that occurs naturally in many situations. 
The bell curve is symmetrical. Half of the data will fall to the left of the mean; half will fall to the right.

For normal distribution, 

-The mean, mode and median are all equal.
-The curve is symmetric at the center (i.e. around the mean, µ).
-Exactly half of the values are to the left of center and exactly half the values are to the right.
-The total area under the curve is 1.


What is a Gaussian Distribution?

Gaussian Distribution is another name for a normal distribution.

In statistics, the normal distribution is called the normal curve.
In the social sciences, it’s called the bell curve (because of it’s shape).
In physics, it’s called the Gaussian distribution.

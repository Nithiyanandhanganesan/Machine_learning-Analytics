Hypothesis Testing:
----------------------

The main purpose of statistics is to test a hypothesis. For example, you might run an experiment and find that a certain drug is effective at treating headaches. 
But if you can’t repeat that experiment, no one will take your results seriously.

A hypothesis is an educated guess about something in the world around you. It should be testable, either by experiment or observation. 
For example:
 - A new medicine you think might work.
 - A way of teaching you think might be better.
 - If I (decrease the amount of water given to herbs) then (the herbs will increase in size).



Null Hypothesis:
------------------
If you trace back the history of science, the null hypothesis is always the accepted fact. 
Simple examples of null hypotheses that are generally accepted as being true are:

 - DNA is shaped like a double helix.
 - There are 8 planets in the solar system (excluding Pluto).


A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data.

STEPS:
==========

1. STATE NULL HYPOTHESIS(H0) OR ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS(H1)
2. CHOOSE THE LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE. (area in the tails)
3. find the critical values. (z value or t value)

Standard deviation is a measure of dispersement in statistics. “Dispersement” just means how much your data is spread out. 
Specifically, it shows you how much your data is spread out around the mean or average.

The empirical rule tells you what percentage of your data falls within a certain number of standard deviations from the mean:
• 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.
• 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.
• 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean.

For eg: if standard deviation is 14 and mean =50, then 68% data falls between (50 - 14) and (50 + 14) , 95% of data falls between (50 - 28) and (50 + 28)

When the bell curve is flattened (your data is spread out), you have a large standard deviation — your data is further away from the mean. 
When the bell curve is very steep, your data has a small standard deviation — your data is tightly clustered around the mean.

Binomial distribution:
------------------------

A binomial distribution is one of the simplest types of distributions in statistics. It’s a type of distribution where there is either success, or failure. 
For example, winning the lottery: or not winning the lottery.

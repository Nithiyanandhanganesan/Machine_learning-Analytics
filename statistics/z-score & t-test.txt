z-score:
===================

z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean a data point is.
Z-score helps to find the common behaviour and exception behaviour.

A z-score is also known as a standard score and it can be placed on a normal distribution curve. Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations 
(which would fall to the far left of the normal distribution curve) up to +3 standard deviations 
(which would fall to the far right of the normal distribution curve).

If z-score is between -1 to +1 , then the observation is common, 
              greater than -3 and greater than 3, then outliers.

z = (x – µ) / s

For example:

A z-score of 1 is 1 standard deviation above the mean.
A score of 2 is 2 standard deviations above the mean.
A score of -1.8 is -1.8 standard deviations below the mean.

In case of left side skewness, then it has large negative z-scores.

t-score & t-test:
=====================

A t-test helps you compare whether two groups have different average values (for example, whether men and women have different average heights).

A t-test asks whether a difference between two groups’ averages is unlikely to have occurred because of random chance in sample selection. A difference is more likely to be meaningful and “real” if
(1) the difference between the averages is large,
(2) the sample size is large, and
(3) responses are consistently close to the average values and not widely spread out (the standard deviation is low).


if t-score is 0, then mean of sample data and actual data is same.

p-score:
=============================

if alpha level is 100%, if confidence level is 98% , the p-value= 0.02 which 2%.

if p-value,
    less than or equal to 0.05 then reject the null hyphothesis.
    greater than 0.05, then dont reject null hyphothesis.


P-Value in Statistical Hypothesis Tests: What is it?
Statistics Definitions > P Value

P Value Definition
Watch the video or read the article below:

A p value is used in hypothesis testing to help you support or reject the null hypothesis. The p value is the evidence against a null hypothesis. 
The smaller the p-value, the strong the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis.

For example, a p value of 0.0254 is 2.54%. This means there is a 2.54% chance your results could be random (i.e. happened by chance). 
That’s pretty tiny. On the other hand, a large p-value of .9(90%) means your results have a 90% probability of being completely random and 
not due to anything in your experiment. 
Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the more important (“significant”) your results.

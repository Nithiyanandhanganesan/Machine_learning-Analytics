It is a classification not a regression algorithm. It is used to estimate discrete values ( Binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false ) 
based on given set of independent variable(s). In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function. 
Hence, it is also known as logit regression. Since, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).

Eg:

Let’s say your friend gives you a puzzle to solve. There are only 2 outcome scenarios – either you solve it or you don’t. 
Now imagine, that you are being given wide range of puzzles / quizzes in an attempt to understand which subjects you are good at. 
The outcome to this study would be something like this – if you are given a trignometry based tenth grade problem, you are 70% likely to solve it. 
On the other hand, if it is grade fifth history question, the probability of getting an answer is only 30%.

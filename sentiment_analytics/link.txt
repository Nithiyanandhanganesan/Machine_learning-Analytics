I have started with sentiment analytics. I have done below steps:
1. Collected twitter feeds and manually updated the sentiment for 50%(train set) of data.
2. Tokenized(train set) into words using tokenizer.
3. Removed stop words
4. Applied the tf-idf to find the word frequency.
Now my train set is clean , and trained the model using naive bayes. 

I have remaining 50% feeds(test set). Now I have to test the test set with trained model. Test set may have some new words. So, in which step I need to include the sentiment dictionary which has list of positive and negative words?

Variables:
------------------

Categorical (for example: young, old).
   - ordinal,nominal
     Ordinal (for example: 0, 1).
Numeric (for example: 1.3, 2.1, 3.2, and so on).
   - discrete,continuous


These algorithms are either grouped by the learning subfields (such as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, semi-supervised, or deep) 
or the problem categories (such as Classification, Regression, Clustering or Optimization). 


Logical models are more algorithmic in nature and help us derive a set of rules by running the algorithms iteratively. A Decision tree is one such example
Geometric models use geometric concepts such as lines, planes, and distances. These models usually operate, or can operate, on high volumes of data. 
Probabilistic models are statistical models that employ statistical techniques. These models are based on a strategy that defines the relationship between two variables



data inconsistencies:
=========================

Under-fitting:
--------------

A model is said to be under-fitting when it doesn't take into consideration enough information to accurately model the actual data.
under-fitting is caused not just due to a lack of data, but can also be a result of incorrect modeling.
The accuracy of the model is determined by a measure called "power" in the statistical world. 
If the dataset size is too small, we can never target an optimal solution.


Over-fitting:
--------------

While too small a sample is not appropriate to define an optimal solution, a large dataset also runs the risk of having the model over-fit the data.


LEARNING TYPES:
====================

Classification, 
Regression, 
clustering 
Optimization
Simulation


Classification:
=================

Classification is a way to identify a grouping technique for a given dataset in such a way that depending on a value of the target or output attribute, 
the entire dataset can be qualified to belong to a class.

eg: all the customers who spend more than 800 dollars in a single purchase are categorized as good customers
